# Chapter 1

There once was a frog that lived on a mountain — in a rain forest. His name was Dart {{insert last name}}. Dart had a special super power — he was venomous! He also had a big weakness; Dart was very small.

Dart loved his home in the rainforest, it was extra cozy with wet leaves and occassionally ants would wander in for dinner. Dart did not love the birds or the monkeys; he preferred to stay inside.
